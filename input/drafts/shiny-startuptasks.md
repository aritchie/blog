Startup tasks in Shiny are similar to IStartable's in Autofac if you've ever used them.  Since Shiny is essentially DI agnostic, I wanted this feature to be available to all things DI.

## How do startup tasks differ from a job?

## How do I make one?

## Careful!!
These things should execute very quickly as you will pay a startup cost otherwise
