## Shiny.Framework

Do you like Prism....?  Let's face it, everyone does.  If you are new to Reactive programming, you may not like it or have
So many cool things upcoming, 

Speaking of which, we've add a all-new samples repo.  People have asked been asking for the "non-kitchen sink" version of using each library (some not so nicely - shame on you!!).  
Well, these things don't grow on trees, but I made it happen.  Checkout <?# ConfiguredLink "Samples" /?>.  If you find an issue with one, please submit
a PR.  A lot of work goes into things, but stuff happens!

Prism+ReactiveUI+Shiny
Localization - Resource localization out of the box. Use it from your viewmodel, your view, no Xamarin Forms tricks - {Binding [YourResourceKey]}
Dialogs - Built
Global Command Exception Handling - It logs, it alerts, it localizes alerts - is there anything it doesn't do with almost no code?
A Base ViewModel on steroids!

Yes - Shiny.Framework is opinionated in the fact that some things are chosen for you.  In order to work with Prism, DryIoc is used behind the scenes for all things DI, but it is never seen once in your project.  Ignorance is bliss right?
