<Image src={me} width="150" alt="Allan Ritchie" /> Hello — I'm Allan Ritchie.

I'm a software engineer, architect, consultant, and open source maintainer with experience spanning web, mobile, and everything in between — from startups to large enterprises.

Over a 25-year career I've shipped software across industries including commercial real estate, healthcare, and logistics. Starting with Perl, PHP, Java, C++, and classic ASP, I've since worked across the full modern stack. For the past seven years I've run my own consultancy, Shiny Soft, helping companies deliver mobile apps, web applications, backend services, and cloud infrastructure.

I'm also a dedicated open source contributor. Over the past 15 years I've authored and maintained numerous .NET libraries — beginning with contributions to NHibernate and other established projects before creating my own. Collectively, my libraries have surpassed 40 million downloads.

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge through public speaking and livestreaming. My contributions have been recognized with the Xamarin MVP award and, since 2017, the [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/501ddb3a-4d15-e711-810b-3863bb36edf8) award — an honour I've held for eight consecutive years.

I'm driven by helping teams turn ideas into products. If you're looking for guidance on your next project, I'd love to hear from you: [allan.ritchie@gmail.com](mailto:allan.ritchie@gmail.com)

### GoneDotNet
I co-host [Gone .NET](https://youtube.com/@GoneDotNet), a weekly YouTube livestream with [Jonathan Dick (redth)](https://x.com/redth), where we go beyond the basics — building real-world .NET samples and exploring the ecosystem in depth.
