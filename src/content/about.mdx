<Image src={me} width="150" alt="Allan Ritchie" /> Hi There, my name is Allan Ritchie

I'm a software engineer, architect, consultant, and open source maintainer.  I've worked on everything from web to mobile and all the "things" in between.  I've worked with startups, enterprises, and general consultancies.  

In my early days, I started with Perl, PHP, Java, C++, and classic ASP.  Over the last 25 years, I've shipped software in many different industries from commercial property real estate, healthcare, logistics, and many more all ranging in size from startup to large enterprise. For the past 7 years, I've been focused on my own consultancy 'Shiny Soft' by helping companies deliver software to their customers.  This has included everything from mobile apps, web apps, backend services, and cloud infrastructure.

Over the last 15 years, I turned my work into a passion building open source.  When I started working in .NET, I worked in NHibernate and other big libraries before developing my own.  I'm author and maintainer of many libraries listed below and have amassed over 40 million downloads.

I've also had the honour & privilege to spread my knowledge to other engineers through speaking and livestreaming all over the globe. My work earned several awards such as Xamarin MVP & in 2017, Microsoft also honoured me with [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/501ddb3a-4d15-e711-810b-3863bb36edf8) for which I have received for the last 8 years running. 

My passion has always been helping people bring technology to their customers.  If you're looking for help with your next project, please get in touch! [allan.ritchie@gmail.com](mailto:allan.ritchie@gmail.com)

### GoneDotNet
I co-host a weekly livestream on YouTube with my good friend [Jonathan Dick - redth](https://x.com/redth) called [Gone .NET](https://youtube.com/@GoneDotNet).  We don't just talk about all things .NET, we build some real world samples beyond the essentials.
