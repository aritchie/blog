.NET MAUI officially targets iOS, Android, macOS (via Mac Catalyst), and Windows. That's the list. Apple TV? Not on it. Native macOS AppKit? Nope — you get Mac Catalyst, which is really an iPad app wearing a trench coat.

The [GoneDotNet/mauiplatforms](https://github.com/GoneDotNet/mauiplatforms) project changes that. It provides custom .NET MAUI backends for **Apple TV (tvOS via UIKit)** and **macOS (native AppKit)** — two platforms that Microsoft has no plans to support.

---

## See It Running

Before diving into the technical details, see for yourself. These are the sample apps running on each platform:

### Apple TV (tvOS Simulator)

<video controls width="100%">
  <source src="https://github.com/GoneDotNet/mauiplatforms/raw/main/maui_appletv.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### macOS (Native AppKit)

<video controls width="100%">
  <source src="https://github.com/GoneDotNet/mauiplatforms/raw/main/maui_macos.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

---

## How It Works

Both backends use the **platform-agnostic MAUI NuGet packages** — the `net10.0` fallback assemblies that ship with MAUI. Since tvOS and macOS (AppKit) aren't recognized TFMs by MAUI, NuGet resolves to these fallback assemblies where `ToPlatform()` returns `object` and layout methods are no-ops.

The project provides custom handler implementations that bridge MAUI's layout and rendering system to the native platform UI frameworks:

- **tvOS** — maps MAUI controls to UIKit views (UILabel, UIButton, UIScrollView, etc.)
- **macOS** — maps MAUI controls to AppKit views (NSTextField, NSButton, NSScrollView, etc.)

Custom base handlers (`TvOSViewHandler` / `MacOSViewHandler`) override the no-op `PlatformArrange` and `GetDesiredSize` to bridge MAUI's layout system to native view frames. On macOS, all container views override `IsFlipped => true` because NSView uses bottom-left origin by default, while MAUI expects top-left coordinates.

---

## What's Implemented

The handler coverage is impressive for a community project. Both platforms share a common set of control handlers:

| Control | tvOS (UIKit) | macOS (AppKit) |
|---|---|---|
| Label | UILabel | NSTextField |
| Button | UIButton | NSButton |
| Entry | UITextField | NSTextField |
| Editor | ❌ | NSTextView |
| Picker | UIButton + UIAlertController | NSPopUpButton |
| Slider | Custom TvOSSliderView | NSSlider |
| Switch | UIButton (toggle) | NSSwitch |
| CheckBox | ❌ | NSButton (checkbox) |
| ActivityIndicator | UIActivityIndicatorView | NSProgressIndicator |
| ProgressBar | UIProgressView | NSProgressIndicator |
| Image | UIImageView | NSImageView |
| ScrollView | UIScrollView | NSScrollView |
| CollectionView | UIScrollView | NSScrollView |
| CarouselView | UIScrollView (paging) | ❌ |
| NavigationPage | ✅ Stack navigation | ✅ Stack navigation |
| TabbedPage | Custom tab bar | NSSegmentedControl |
| WebView | ❌ | WKWebView |
| BlazorWebView | ❌ | ✅ Custom implementation |
| DatePicker / TimePicker | ❌ | NSDatePicker |
| Border / Shadow / ShapeView | ✅ CAShapeLayer | ✅ CAShapeLayer |

That's a *lot* of controls. And there's Essentials support too — AppInfo, DeviceInfo, Connectivity, Battery (macOS), DeviceDisplay, FileSystem, Preferences, SecureStorage, FilePicker (macOS), MediaPicker (macOS), and TextToSpeech all have platform-specific implementations.

## BlazorWebView on macOS

One of the standout features is a working **BlazorWebView on native macOS AppKit**. The built-in MAUI BlazorWebView internally casts its handler to the iOS/Catalyst `BlazorWebViewHandler`, which obviously fails on AppKit.

The project works around this with a custom `MacOSBlazorWebView` control backed by WKWebView, a custom `app://` URL scheme handler, and a bridge between MAUI's `IDispatcher` and Blazor's abstract `Dispatcher`. It even serves static content from the macOS app bundle's Resources directory.

```csharp
var blazorView = new MacOSBlazorWebView
{
    HostPage = "wwwroot/index.html",
    HeightRequest = 400
};
blazorView.RootComponents.Add(new BlazorRootComponent
{
    Selector = "#app",
    ComponentType = typeof(MyApp.Components.Counter)
});
```

## Building & Running

Everything is CLI-only — JetBrains Rider and Visual Studio won't compile these projects because the `net10.0-tvos` and `net10.0-macos` TFMs aren't recognized by IDE build systems. You'll need the .NET 10 SDK with the tvOS and macOS workloads installed:

```bash
dotnet workload install tvos macos

# Build & run the tvOS sample (launches in simulator)
dotnet build samples/SampleTv/SampleTv.csproj -t:Run

# Build & run the macOS sample
dotnet build samples/SampleMac/SampleMac.csproj
open samples/SampleMac/bin/Debug/net10.0-macos/osx-arm64/MAUI\ macOS.app
```

Sample apps use pure C# pages (no XAML) to avoid XAML compilation issues on unsupported platforms.

## Why This Matters

This project is a proof of concept that demonstrates MAUI's architecture is flexible enough to target platforms beyond Microsoft's official support matrix. The platform-agnostic fallback assemblies that ship with MAUI NuGet packages — originally there for compatibility — become the foundation for entirely new platform backends.

It also opens up interesting possibilities:
- **Apple TV apps** built with .NET and MAUI's familiar API surface
- **Native macOS apps** without the compromises of Mac Catalyst
- A template for bringing MAUI to **other platforms** in the future
